# Keeper
Keeper is A password manager, digital vault, form filler and secure digital wallet. Keeper remembers all your passwords for you to help keep account information safe.

device level encryption is REALLY simple. it just means that the data being encrypted only exists in plaintext on the users device (phone, computer, whatever). The key to encrypt and decrypt is only ever instantiated on the users device. Thus, all that would leave the users device (phone, computer, whatever) is the encrypted cipher text. I have added more detail to your other question.
